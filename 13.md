## 13

Cryptography can be easy do you know what ROT13 is ?.

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}`

As the challenge suggests that we should learn about ROT13 which is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it
in the Latin alphabet.It is a special case of the Caesar cipher. Now what i did was just paste "cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}" in ROT13 and got the flag.

### New Learnings
I learnt about Ceaser cipher and ROT13.

### References 
None.

## Rail fence
In this challenge we are given a code and we have decrypt it using the rail fence method.

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_D00AFDD3}`

As given in the challenge that we have to decrpyt the code using the rail fence method and it is also given that the no. of rails is 4
which means that the depth of the cipher is 4. Now for the solving part the code given was "Ta _7N6DDDhlg:W3D_H3C31N__0D3ef sHR053F38N43D0F i33___NA". After counting we got that there are 56 characters in this code and for the solving part i started by making a matrix of 4x56 and
started filling the matrix by taking the first character and leaving the diagonals. After completing i got the flag.
which translated to "The flag is WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_D00AFDD3"
